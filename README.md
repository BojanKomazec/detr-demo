# Object Detection with DETR (Detection Transformer)

This project is based on https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/detr/blob/colab/notebooks/detr_demo.ipynb.
The initial commit is its copy and it contains the following project description.


> Object Detection with DETR - a minimal implementation
> In this notebook we show a demo of DETR (Detection Transformer), with slight differences with the baseline model in the paper.
> We show how to define the model, load pretrained weights and visualize bounding box and class predictions.


## How to run this Python notebook?

```
$ conda env create -f detr-demo.yml
$ conda activate detr-demo
$ jupyter-lab // opens http://localhost:8888/lab in a local browser
...
$ conda deactivate // after finishing the work
